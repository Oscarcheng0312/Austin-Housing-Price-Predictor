    "# DSCI 100 Group 10 Project Proposal: Austin, TX Housing Prices\n",
    "#### Bhagat Basra, Oscar Cheng, Lucas Wei, Wanning Zhang\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Housing prices are dependent on a multitude of variables. We will be investigating the housing market in Austin, Texas, the tenth-most populous city in the United States and the price of single-family homes in this area (Moskowitz, 2024). Prices of homes are influenced by a variety of factors including the size, the number of bedrooms, the quality of the nearby school, and its age (Zietz et al., 2008). We chose to investigate these variables because we observed a relationship between them and the house price. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question we will try to answer with our project is, **\"Can we predict the housing prices of single-family homes in Austin, Texas based on the living area square footage, number of bedrooms, average school rating, and year it was built?”**\n",
    "The dataset we will be using is called “Austin, TX House Listings”. This dataset contains house listing data from 2021. "

    "These graphs above show visulaizations of our results. There are 4 graphs of each predictor variable vs. price, along with an overlayed line of the predicted house prices. We chose to show each predictor seperately because in order to accurately showcase the results with one figure, there would need to be a 5 dimensional plot, which is not possible. The relationships shown may look weak or not accurate but this is because the model takes all the predictors into account, so relationships between predictors are not able to be shown. Therefore, it is more important to look at the RMSE to determine if our model was successful, which it is because our RMSE is low. Analyzing these plots, house size seems to be the strongest predictor variable as its plot most aligns with the predicted values line. "

    "We have found a model that predicts the single family house price in Austin, TX. It had a RMSE value of around 31,000 dollars which suggests that the model is sufficient enough to predict the housing prices because the average single family house price is around 520,000 US dollar, and 31,000 US dollar is much smaller compared to the average price. \n",

    "This result is what we expected from the model because of our process for selecting the k value. We created a big range of k values with large increments. Then we refined to the smaller k value range with smaller increments, where it made more sense after seeing the graph generated with the larger values. This ensures us to find the right k-value that works the best for this project. Another key point of why we expected this model to work is because of the amount of decision making we established before we decided on our predictors. We intentionally selected the predictors of which it is more reasonable by looking at the graph generated and seeing if they had a general trend relating to the price of the house. \n",

    "Creating an accurate model of housing prices given certain input variables can have great impact. This would allow home owners to predict the price of their house to ensure that they were asking for a fair value. Another possible impact of this model is that it would allow real estate investors to use the model to identify undervalued property, increasing potential returns. Another way this model could be used is by banks and other mortgage lenders to appropriately asses the risk of a loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some future questions and investigations that could be explored is if using more variables will create a more accurate model. It could also be investigated which variables effect home price the most. There also other factors that we were not able to incorporate into the model because they were not in our data set, such as transit proximity, which can have an effect on housing price (Yu et al., 2016). Furthermore, more than just single family homes could be studied such as apartments, townhomes, or condos and in cities other than Austin, Texas."
